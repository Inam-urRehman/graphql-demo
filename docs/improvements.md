## Improvements

Following are the notable improvements

### Typescript

I have used typescript in this application. By using typescript application becomes more scalable and maintainable. Also, it increases the productivity and quality of the project.

### React Query

You don't need to worry about server caching e.g. storing data in a global state and then putting custom logic to cache, fetch and preview data.

> Fetch, cache, and update data in your React and React Native
> applications all without touching any "global state"

### Ant Design

One of the most popular design system libraries. No need to worry about the UI and UX of base components.

### Separation of concern

The project structure is so simple and follow the `separation of concern` principle in terms of js and css. You have a separate folder for styling and JS/TS in a separate folder.

### Reduced API calls

I try my best to reduce the API call rate by using react-query. By using react-router-dom location state, it's easy to transfer data from one page to another e.g. In this application when we click on row item next page is populated from state data. So here we don't need to get data from backend API on individual characters.

### Things need to be improved

Due to a shortage of time, I could not improve the styling of the application. So UI/UX can be improved in some areas.
